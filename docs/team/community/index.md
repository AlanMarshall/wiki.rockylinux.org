## About

The Community Team is responsible for interacting with and maintaining the Rocky Linux Community, in accordance with the Charter and By-Laws of the project.

Everyone who is part of Rocky Linux is a member of the Community team, and is charged with upholding the standard of our community, specifically: being curteous and treating all people--within and without the RESF--with respect. While discourse is often necessary in projects with multiple voices, it is our responsibility to remember we are all human and are working together for the good of the community overall.

In addition to the above, the community team runs outreach for Rocky, including managing social channels, moderating mailing lists, and more. This is an area that is always in need of participation and we welcome anyone who would like to be part of it.

### Management

This team is lead by Brian Clemens and Gregory Curtzer, along with all the Team Leads.
