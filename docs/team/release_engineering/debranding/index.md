title: Intro to Debranding with Rocky Linux
---

## What is Debranding?

Certain packages in the upstream RHEL/CentOS have logos, trademarks, and other specific text, images, or multimedia that other entities (like the Rocky Linux Foundation) are not allowed to redistribute.

A visible, simple example is the Apache web server (package httpd).  If you've ever installed it and visited the default web server page, you will see a test page specific to your Linux distro, complete with a "powered by" logo and distro-specific information.  While we are allowed to compile and redistribute the Apache web server software, Rocky Linux is NOT allowed to include these trademarked images or distro-specific text!

We must have an automated process that will strip these assets out and replace them with our own branding upon import into our Gitlab.

## How Rocky Debranding Works

Rocky's method for importing packages from the upstream is a tool called **srpmproc** ( https://git.rockylinux.org/release-engineering/public/srpmproc )

Srpmproc's purpose in life is to:

- Clone PACKAGE from our upstream source: git.centos.org/rpms/PACKAGE
- Check if Rocky Linux has any debranding patches available for PACKAGE (under https://git.rockylinux.org/patch/PACKAGE )
- If patch/PACKAGE exists, then read the configuration and patches from that repository and apply them
- Commit the results (patched or not) to https://git.rockylinux.org/rpms/PACKAGE
- Do this for every package until we have a full repository of packages in our Git

## How Many Packages are we Talking About?

That is an open question.  We know, at a minimum, there are **40 packages** referred to in the CentOS 8 release notes that need to be modified from upstream.  (34 modified, 6 added.  See:  https://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS8.1905#Packages_modified_by_CentOS )

However, we also know this list is incomplete.  For example, package **nginx** (a popular web server) has not been rebranded by CentOS, but should be.  We cannot include this package as-is, it must be debranded before it's imported to Rocky Linux's Git.

### Open Call for Help: 
Like nginx, there are undoubtedly more packages that are not on the default CentOS list, but must be debranded.  We are trying to build a complete list, but **we need YOUR help!**  

The Rocky Linux community includes a metric ton of CentOS/RHEL administrators who collectively are familiar with the ENTIRE package base.  If you notice a package that has upstream branding, but is not on our tracking list, PLEASE let us know!  We prefer you drop by channel **#Dev/Packaging** on chat.rockylinux.org , but any way you can get the message to us is acceptable!

## Helping with Debrands

There are 2 tasks involved with debranding.  Identifying packages that require debranding (see call for help above), and developing patches+configs to debrand the necessary packages.

If you want to help with the latter, please see "**[Rocky Debrand How-To](/team/development/debranding/Debrand_Howto)**" located in the same folder of this Wiki.

## Debrand Packages Tracking

A list of packages that need debranding and their status is located in the Wiki in this folder under: **Debranding/Debrand_Tracking**.  It will be updated as debrand patches are submitted and the needed packages are identified.
