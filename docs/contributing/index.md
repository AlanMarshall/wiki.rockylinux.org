This section of the wiki contains various articles that detail how to
contribute to Rocky, such as agreements and onboarding. The agreements
here will also be in our RAS (Rocky Account Services) system that will
require contributors to sign.

Previously this page contained a link to a form that anyone could fill
out to contribute. However, we feel that this section of the wiki can
help more easily in that regard.

## Quick Start

As with most online and/or open source communities, getting started
usually begins at the "joining" phase and just participating in topics that
interest you. Here's some basic things you can do to get you going:

* Join our [mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org) and search for channels that interest you

* Check out our [forums](https://forums.rockylinux.org) and [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/rockylinux)

For a more detailed guide, see our [getting started](start.md) guide.
