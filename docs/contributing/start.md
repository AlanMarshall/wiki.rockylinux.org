Contributing to Rocky Linux should be easy and straight forward for any user
who wishes to participate or would like to contribute in any way. This could
be through a Special Interest Group, or it could just be to the core Rocky
Linux distribution.

# Purpose

This page goes over the basic steps to signing up for an account with our
Rocky Account Services and other basics with interacting with the Rocky
ecosystem.

# Quick Start Guide

This section will go over the very basics of signing up for an account
and filling in basic information in Rocky Account Services.

## Creating an Account

## Profile Information

## Signing Agreements

## Requesting Access to Groups/SIGs

Each group/SIG will have different procedures for becoming part of the groups
within Rocky Account Services. Most groups will require agreement(s) to be
signed, others may be on a request basis. Each group should have "sponsors"
that can be contacted with information on joining the groups. They can be
contacted in the [mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org).

Some sponsors may have additional links they'll send you from the wiki that
will detail the procedure they expect you to follow.

In general, the baseline steps to requesting access comes down to this:

* Create your account in RAS
* Fill out your profile
* Sign the appropriate agreements
* Find the group or groups you wish to join and find the sponsors
* Contact the sponsor directly or send a message to appropriate channel for the group

# Details

This section will go over a more detailed overview of various aspects of the
Rocky Account Services as well as pieces of infrastructure you may interact
with.

## Agreements

Agreements in Rocky Account Services are there to show that you understand
and agree to the terms in how you are expected to use Rocky-related services.

You will find 100% of the time, you will be required to sign at least one of
the agreements, and that's the `Rocky Open Source Contributor Agreement`. If
you plan on utilizing git.rockylinux.org (as most contributors will), signing
of the `Rocky Linux GitLab Contributor Agreement` is a requirement.

Before a sponsor or a team leader will add you to a group, they will have the
ability to check your profile to verify that you have signed the appropriate
agreements before proceeding. If you do not or cannot agree to the terms, you
will not be able to contribute to Rocky within its own ecosystem. (Note that
this does not stop you from contributing to the github repositories.)
