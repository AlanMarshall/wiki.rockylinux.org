## Release

### rocky-release packages

It is expected with Special Interest Groups that are delivering packages to have associated release packages that provide:

* Repo file(s) for dnf
* GPG key associated with the signing of your packages

!!! info "Key/Package Restrictions"
    The Special Interest Group cannot submit a key nor can they have access to the private key. A SIG cannot submit their own release package.

During the initial request process, a GPG key is assigned to you in the build system to be used to sign your packages. A release package must be requested to be built and submitted to the extras repository. In the event that a release package was not requested nor fulfilled during the initial request, a new request can be opened at [SIG/Core Issues](git.resf.org/sig-core/meta).

When submitting the request, click on the "[New Issue](https://git.resf.org/sig_core/meta/issues/new/choose)" button and then click "[Get Started](https://git.resf.org/sig_core/meta/issues/new?template=.gitea%2fISSUE_TEMPLATE%2fsig_release_request.md)" for "Requests for SIG Release Package" and fill out the template as shown, which includes:

  * An introduction of yourself and the request for the release package
  * Number of repositories and names
  * Note if there are plans for multiple versions of software
  * Note if there are modularity repositories
  * Which major versions you are targeting (Rocky Linux 8, 9, and so on)
  * Other details if needed

### Releasing Packages for your SIG

TBD. As of now, releasing requires feedback to SIG/Core / Release Engineering to push out to mirrors.

### Directory Format for Repositories (Informational)

This is informational more than anything, but it is important for a SIG to know where their exported repositories will live.

Repositories will be formatted as such:

`/pub/sig/MAJOR/NAME/ARCH/PKG_OR_REPO`

This basically means that the sig directory will live along side the main distribution directories, potentially at the root a mirror. At `/pub/rocky` you'll see each supported major version. At `/pub/sig` you'll also see major versions, with a different structure. Let's break it down.

* `NAME` can be the name of the SIG or the abbreviation code (eg, cloud, kernel, mcs)
* `MAJOR` is the major version that's being targeted (8, 9, so on)
* `ARCH` is for the architecture
* `PKG_OR_REPO` could be for the specific set of packages of just any repository. (For example, you could have a "common" directory alongside the others)

Let's say for the sake of the example we need some repositories for mcs and we build for x86_64 and aarch64. It could look like this. This assumes the messaging and communication SIG has not only an ejabberd repository, but also a "common" repository that is perhaps shared with ejabberd and potentially another set of packages in the future.

### Mirror List Queries (Informational)

Queries to a mirror list for SIG repositories will be like the standard calls, but repo names will have a format of `sig-NAME-MAJOR`. `NAME` can be a simple SIG name or abbreviate or a combination, for example, `sig-mcs-common` or `sig-cloud`.
